# OpenClassrooms - React interm√©diaire

App created during a OpenClassrooms course.  
What I learned in this course:
* Work with a formated code with ESLint and Prettier
* React Router v5 / v6
* Styled Components
* Use API with React and async functions
* Hooks (useContext, useEffect, useState and my own hooks)
* Testing with Jest and React testing lybrary
* Old React syntax (no hooks, components made with Class)
* PropTypes
### Check out the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/KlrToaA7Dj1Sm0opq37ICg/React-interm%C3%A9diaire?node-id=0%3A1)
## To make that app work :

* Clone this repo for the app
* Clone [this repo](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/7150606-API-React-intermediaire) to run the local API server 

## Then :

### run `npm install` on both
### On the app run `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## To make the API work :

### On the API run `npm start`
And Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.
